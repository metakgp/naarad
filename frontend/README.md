## Usage

This is the custom frontend for our custom backend logic for registering users on naarad, providing **read-only** access to `kgp-*` channels.

## Development Server

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

## Deployment

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
You can now deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
